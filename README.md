Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mathieu, I am a Ruby on Rails developer.

I am currently working as a Fullstack RoR developper at [Madeinvote](https://www.madeinvote.com/).<br>
Their repository is on Gitlab so I'll be more active [there](https://gitlab.com/Mth0158).

If you like my work and want me to be able to keep improving it, please follow me on GitHub or on Gitlab ([here](https://gitlab.com/Mth0158))!
