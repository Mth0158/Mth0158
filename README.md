Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mathieu, I've recently graduated from Le Wagon Lyon (Batch 548) and I am now coding on my own.

I am Ruby and Rails developer and mainly interested by back-end subjects.

I am currently working on updating and refactoring <a href="https://github.com/Mth0158/keyz">Keyz</a> which is our final project developed during Le Wagon bootcamp.


If you like my work and want me to be able to keep improving it, please follow me on GitHub.
